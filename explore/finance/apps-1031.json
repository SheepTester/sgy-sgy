      "DESCRIBE THE EVENT, TRY TO INCLUDE HOW IT RELATES TO YOUR MISSION OR VALUES": "The Welcoming Ceremony is one of the most important annual events of the Chinese Global Community. The purpose of this event is to reunite the returning students and welcome the new students to our campus, as well as help the international students to integrate into the UCSD community. \r\nSpecifically, the “CGC Opening Ceremony” is a grand opening ceremony that primarily features stage performances. This celebration marks the commencement of the new academic year, showcasing a variety of artistic expressions through dance, drama, and music performances, reflecting the cultural diversity and creative talents within the academic community. Our goal for this opening ceremony is not only to let new students know how CGC could help them in their future University life but also to create a sense of belonging to them in this brand-new life. In addition, we are committed to helping new students get a quicker understanding of the facilities and the various departments available to them, and we will introduce UCSD to students at this opening ceremony so that they will not be unfamiliar with the campus. We also organize audience interactions so that new students can make friends from the moment they arrive and not be alone. This event is open to every single student (including newly admitted, transferring, and current students) and every staff member in the UC San Diego community. We hope that this event will serve as a mobilization for the start of the new academic year, encouraging students and staff to work together and enjoy their new academic life.",
