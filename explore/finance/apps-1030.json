The show will feature two other dance groups on campus, Muse Dance Company and Ikigai Dance Company.\r\nThe theme of the show is Alice in Wonderland interpretations. For company members, the event itself and preparation for it aim to improve students’ out-of-classroom experience by providing students with a social event, while promoting a balance of academics, personal growth, and extracurriculars. For potential attendees, the performance is an opportunity for students and the UCSD community at large to gain exposure to the arts–ballet specifically–and enrich their experience at UCSD with a live performance of ballet conveniently located on campus. Student attendees may also appreciate the opportunity of connecting with other peers who attend the performance, along with connecting with their dance-maker peers by witnessing their styles of storytelling through movement.  \r\nOverall, Aequora Ballet Company aims to foster a diverse and inclusive classical and contemporary dance community for students to connect and improve their dancing, as well as the opportunity to perform in an annual showcase in which they can share their work with the UCSD community. This is our third year in-person as a student organization and fourth year overall, and we would use the funds to cover the Price Center venue and services.",

      "DESCRIBE THE EVENT, TRY TO INCLUDE HOW IT RELATES TO YOUR MISSION OR VALUES": "This event is the second day of dress/tech rehearsals (7PM-10PM) for a performance in Spring Quarter in which Aequora Ballet Company members will dance classical and contemporary ballet choreography. The show will feature two other dance groups on campus, Muse Dance Company and Ikigai Dance Company.\r\nThe theme of the show is Alice in Wonderland interpretations. For company members, the event itself and preparation for it aim to improve students’ out-of-classroom experience by providing students with a social event, while promoting a balance of academics, personal growth, and extracurriculars. For potential attendees, the performance is an opportunity for students and the UCSD community at large to gain exposure to the arts–ballet specifically–and enrich their experience at UCSD with a live performance of ballet conveniently located on campus. Student attendees may also appreciate the opportunity of connecting with other peers who attend the performance, along with connecting with their dance-maker peers by witnessing their styles of storytelling through movement.  \r\nOverall, Aequora Ballet Company aims to foster a diverse and inclusive classical and contemporary dance community for students to connect and improve their dancing, as well as the opportunity to perform in an annual showcase in which they can share their work with the UCSD community. This is our third year in-person as a student organization and fourth year overall, and we would use the funds to cover the Price Center venue and services.",

      "DESCRIBE THE EVENT, TRY TO INCLUDE HOW IT RELATES TO YOUR MISSION OR VALUES": "Our organization provides a supportive space for students to interact and connect with each other through school events, learning environments (classroom and tutoring workshops), and personal associations throughout the year. For this reason, the mission statement of our organization is to empower underrepresented students in pursuing higher education and to celebrate cultural diversity. Each year our event has several components to follow our mission statement. Firstly, the event will gather the students in our organization who are from different backgrounds and UCSD colleges to celebrate their accomplishments and growth during the academic year. The event will also validate the achievements of the students in our organization and empower them as we come together as a community and support each other. For instance, the graduating seniors and their families, along with current club members will be recognized and honored for their achievements. In addition, the event will celebrate the diversity in the organization by having food catering that showcases the different cultures in our organization. Throughout the event, we will have a keynote speaker and a senior speaker who will inspire our students to succeed in higher education.",
