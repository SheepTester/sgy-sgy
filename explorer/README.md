# Schoology API

I put the documentation from [Schoology's REST API documentation](https://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/rest-api-v1/) in [sgy-api.yml](./sgy-api.yml) so it's easier for an explorer program to read and a human to maintain.

See [types.ts](./types.ts) for how the YAML file is structured.

```sh
node app.js
```

## Simpler documentation

```sh
node docs-app.js
```
